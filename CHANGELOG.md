## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `QRing` is an alias for `QuotientRing`.
- `test_primality` accepts optional `kwarg`, `iterated_degbound_computation`, with defult value `False`. Behaviour is unchanged on default setting. If set to `True`, the codimensions of ideals involving f-poly factors are computed with subsequently looser degree bounds, until the either a prest degre (18) is exceeded or the codim is greater than that of the original ideal. Use is recommended only for ideals that are expected to be prime and for which the computation without degree bound fails.

### Changed

- Default `max_tries` for `Ideal.point_on_variety` increased to 100 from 10: needed when generating a large number of points.


### Fixed

- Occasinally, when generating a `point_on_variety` with multi-precision complex (`mpc`) the `lex_groebner_basis` computation can return the unit ideal, due to precision loss. Introduced a new `RootPrecisionError` exception and added this to the retry logic.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-12-27

### Added

- Ideal method to generate points of varieties, `Ideal.point_on_variety`.
- Field object (moved from [lips](https://github.com/GDeLaurentis/lips))

### Fixed

- Syntax consistency when printing polynomials over rings with single-character variables (forced `short=0` always).
- Import path in Singular for `poly.lib` is now `polylib.lib`.

## [0.1.3] - 2023-03-02

### Added

- Basic interface functions for `Ring`, `QuotientRing` and `Ideal`.
- Primality test, `Ideal.test_primality`.
